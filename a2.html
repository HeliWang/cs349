<h1>CS 349 Assignment 2: University-Age Mutant Turtle Interfaces!</h1>

<p><strong>The assignment is due Friday, February 7, 2014, at 5PM. No late
assignments will be accepted. Submit early and often!</strong></p>

<p>Source code for the assignment will be available to check out via
Subversion (SVN). See the
<a href="http://hci.uwaterloo.ca/courses/cs349/w14">class web page</a> for more
details about Subversion.</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>The goal of this assignment is to build on what you learned about GUI
toolkits in assignment one. Specifically, you will apply concepts from
class related to:</p>

<ul>
<li>the design and implementation of components (widgets)</li>
<li>painting</li>
<li>event handling</li>
<li>interactor trees</li>
<li>mouse focus</li>
<li>affine transformations</li>
</ul>

<p>You will do so by completing the entire WatGUI toolkit, creating
custom components, and creating an application that supports
displaying and stepping through turtle graphics.</p>

<p>The resulting application will allows users to interactively
manipulate a Logo-like turtle in real-time. While you do not need to
implement the Logo/turtle graphics engine for this assignment,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo_%28programming_language%29
">you may be interested in its history</a>.</p>

<p>The central idea of turtle graphics is that a "turtle" draws on a
surface (piece of paper, screen, etc.) according to a core set of
basic programming instructions. For example, you can tell the turtle
to "rotate" or move "forward".</p>

<p>We have implemented turtle graphics in the toolkit, where instructions
for the turtle can be specified in Scheme or via the C++ API. As
mentioned, you do not need to worry about implementing the turtle
graphics engine, but you must integrate the turtle graphics component
into the application (as described in detail below).</p>

<p>To give you a flavor of the kind of output possible by the turtle
graphics engine provided by the toolkit, here is a 23 point star:</p>

<p><img src="./img/23_point_star.png" alt="23 Point Star" title="" /> </p>

<h2>Completing the Toolkit</h2>

<p>In the toolkit, you must complete the missing portions of the base
WatGUI toolkit, plus some additional files for this assignment. As
before, use grep (or some other search facility) to search for TODO
items in the code. The README.md file contains general information
about the toolkit and files provided.</p>

<p>The provided code is substantially similar to the code base you worked
with in A1. Based on feedback and observations from A1, we have made
some minor modifications to the toolkit to make it easier for you to
understand the code, debug it, and write unit tests for it. We have
also added some new functionality and new files for this assignment.
You may reuse all of your A1 code for this assignment to complete
missing portions of the toolkit, though be aware that you might need
to slightly alter your previous code to fit the aforementioned
changes. (As an example, the eventQueue member variable in
XApplication has changed to a pointer, to allow it to be swapped in
and out at runtime for unit tests.)</p>

<p><em>Note that completing the skeleton code and TODOs will not be
sufficient to complete this assignment -- you will find that you will
need to add new classes, new methods to existing classes, and other
functionality to meet the requirements of this assignment. However, as
before, you may not change the APIs for the code provided, though you
may add to the APIs.</em></p>

<h2>Visual Display and Design</h2>

<p>You will be constructing an interface that resembles the following
sketch:</p>

<p><img src="./img/a2_sketch.png" alt="Assignment 2 Interface Sketch" title="" /> </p>

<p>Note that this is a <em>sketch</em> -- you should use this as a starting
point for making a better design. You must, however, support all the
functionality depicted in the sketch and described below.</p>

<h2>Interaction</h2>

<p>To make the turtle draw, a user can provide commands via the Scheme
ninterpreter. We have already created demo scripts to make the turtle
draw interesting things, like stars. We'll describe how to load the
demo scripts below, but for the most part, you don't need to worry
about the Scheme interpreter or entering turtle commands via the
interpreter.</p>

<p>Once a turtle script is loaded, the TurtleGraphics component is filled
with turtle drawing instructions. The user can use the interface to
play back the instructions to watch the turtle move across the screen.
The following functionality should be available to the user (you must
implement this):</p>

<ul>
<li>Play/pause the turtle animation by using the white-filled triangular
button in the center of the bottom row of buttons</li>
<li>When clicking the black triangular buttons to the immediate left and
right of the play button, the turtle should advance to the
previous/next step, but only if the animation is paused. If it is
running, pressing these buttons should have no effect.</li>
<li>When clicking the black triangular buttons on the far left and right
of the row of buttons, it should advance to the start/end of the
animation. This should happen regardless of whether the animation is
playing or not.</li>
</ul>

<p>As the user plays back the animation or steps through frames, the slider
under the "Current Turtle Step" label should update to reflect the
current position in the animation. In the sample sketch above, there
are 200 frames of animation, and it is currently showing the 100th
frame of the animation.</p>

<p>Users should be able to interactively manipulate the "Current Turtle
Step" slider to randomly access different frames of the turtle
animation. If they start manipulating the slider, the animation should
switch to being "paused" so the animation doesn't try to proceed while
they are adjusting the slider. When they stop manipulating the slider,
the animation should remain paused, regardless of whether it was playing
when they first started manipulating the slider.</p>

<p>There is also a playback rate slider, so users can vary the speed at
which the turtle moves across the screen. More details about playback
rate are provided below.</p>

<p>Both sliders should have labels on either end to indicate the minimum
and maximum values of the slider. The sliders should also display the
current value above the slider's thumb (the solid black rectangle that
the user manipulates).</p>

<p>If the user clicks in the slider control, but not on the thumb, the
thumb should snap to their mouse position. For example, if the user
presses the mouse button near "10x" in the sketch above, the thumb
should snap to that position and track the cursor until the mouse
button is released.</p>

<p>The buttons and sliders should <em>capture the mouse</em> when the user
presses the mouse button in one of the controls. Thus, if the user
presses the mouse down in the play button, then drags the mouse over
to the "next frame" button and releases the mouse button, neither the
play button nor next frame button should activate. Similarly, if the
user starts adjusting the top slider, then drags the mouse to the
other slider (without releasing the mouse button), the top slider
should be the one that is responding to the mouse, not the lower
slider. (We describe additions to the toolkit below that provide a
skeleton for handling mouse focus.)</p>

<h2>The Underlying Implementation and Architecture</h2>

<p>We are providing you with the skeletons of two widget classes: Button
and Slider. You must complete these and use these for the buttons and
sliders of the application.</p>

<p>You will also need to create a Label class that allows you to draw
text at the location of the widget (we have not provided any template
for that class).</p>

<h3>Interactor Tree</h3>

<p>For this assignment, you must create an interactor tree of components
that matches this specification:</p>

<pre><code>Root (The XWindow)
|
---Main Panel (a Panel component that contains all other widgets)
   |
   |---The turtle graphics output panel (a Panel component that contains the turtle graphics widgets)
   |   |
   |   |---The "Turtle Graphics Output" Label
   |   |---The turtle graphics widget (the actual TurtleGraphics component)
   |
   |---Playback panel (a Panel component)
   |   |
   |   |---The "Playback Rate" Label
   |   |---The playback rate Slider
   |
   |---The current turtle step panel (a Panel component)
   |   |
   |   |---The "Current Turtle Step" Label
   |   |---The current turtle step Slider
   |
   |---The button panel (a Panel component)
       |
       |---The "go to start" Button
       |---The "previous frame" Button
       |---The "play" Button
       |---The "next frame" Button
       |---The "go to end" Button
</code></pre>

<p>This interactor tree describes what components are children of other
components. For example, the root node, an XWindow object, contains
the main panel, and only the main panel. The main panel contains four
panels, each of which contains other components. If you follow this
design, we can instantiate your main panel, then embed it in any
XWindow we wish.</p>

<p>The main panel is defined in <code>MainPanel.h/cpp</code>. (Also note that there
is a new Panel class whose sole use is to contain other widgets. Its
implementation is complete.) See MainPanel's constructor for an
example of how we start building the interactor tree defined above.</p>

<h3>Component IDs</h3>

<p>If you look at the Component class, you'll see that its constructor
takes a string argument representing its "name". The name is a unique
identifier for the component, so we can more easily identify a
component in the interactor tree for unit tests. It is not displayed
onscreen by the Component -- its sole use is to aid in debugging and
creating unit tests.</p>

<p>We have created a list of component IDs to use for all of the
components listed in the interactor tree above. See
<code>A2WidgetIdentifiers.h</code> for a list of the constants to use when
constructing each of the components above. Also see the constructor of
MainPanel to see these constants being used when creating the
MainPanel, the turtle graphics panel, and the turtle graphics widget.
<em>You must use these identifiers, or our unit tests will not work.</em></p>

<h3>Mouse Focus</h3>

<p>As mentioned above, your buttons and sliders should properly capture
mouse focus, so that if you start interacting with one widget and drag
the mouse over to another widget, that second widget will not start
receiving the mouse events.</p>

<p>To assist you with handling mouse focus, we have augmented XWindow to
provide methods that enable you to specify which component has mouse
focus. <em>You will need to implement the logic to properly support
mouse focus -- it is not enough to merely specify which Component has
mouse focus. Instead, you must provide the logic within the toolkit so
that mouse focus is properly assigned, released, and acted upon when
receiving new events.</em> Mostly, this amounts to forwarding new
MouseEvents directly to the Component with focus, but you must ensure
that the coordinates within the MouseEvent are properly updated before
handing it off to the Component with focus. (There are some other
subtleties related to capturing and releasing mouse focus by
Components, but with some experimentation, you should be able to get
the basic behavior correct.)</p>

<h3>TurtleGraphics Class/Widget</h3>

<p>The TurtleGraphics class provides facilities for automatically
rendering the turtle graphics to the screen. However, <em>you</em> are
responsible for animating the turtle graphics. You animate the
graphics by sequentially showing each step of the turtle, advancing at
a rate of 10 fps. (You will need to use a Timer to make this animation
work.)</p>

<p>The key methods in TurtleGraphics for you to examine are:</p>

<ul>
<li>GetNumSteps()</li>
<li>GoToStep()</li>
<li>AddValueListener()</li>
</ul>

<p>Once a set of instructions have been loaded, GetNumSteps() returns the
number of steps, or frames, that can be shown by the TurtleGraphics
component. To cue to a specific step/frame, use the GoToStep() method,
which will advance the turtle to that step/frame number.</p>

<p>You should play back the steps at a rate of 10 frames per second
(fps). Thus, if GetNumSteps() returns 100, and the user chooses to
play back the animation from the start, it will take 10 seconds to
show each of the 100 frames.</p>

<p>The rate slider should allow the user to vary the playback speed from
1 fps (1/10th of the normal playback rate), to 100 fps (10 times the
normal playback rate).</p>

<p>As the frames play back, the "Current Turtle Step" slider should
update to reflect the current step number. <em>This slider must also
update its display when a new set of instructions are loaded into the
TurtleGraphics component. You can know when the number of steps has
changed via an ValueListener object.</em> Specifically, create a class
that implements the ValueListener interface, then add a pointer to an
object of that class to TurtleGraphics via its AddValueListener()
method. Objects that implement this interface will automatically have
their ValueChanged() method called when the number of steps in the
TurtleGraphics widget has changed.</p>

<p>For the purposes of testing, whenever TurtleGraphic's
BroadcastInstructionsChanged() method is called, it will tell all
listeners registered with it that its value has changed. So you can
manually call that method to ensure your objects are properly notified
when TurtleGraphics' instructions have changed.</p>

<h3>Turtle Graphics Scripts and Demos (Optional)</h3>

<p>This section briefly describes how to show something more interesting
in the TurtleGraphics component, if you wish. This section can be
skipped, if desired.</p>

<p>When the app first starts up, a random set of TurtleGraphics
operations will execute (they are specified at the end of MainPanel's
constructor).</p>

<p>For something more interesting, you can have it create a star by
entering the following code into the Scheme terminal when the
application starts up:</p>

<pre><code>(turtle-star (find-turtle-graphics-widget) 300 23)
</code></pre>

<p>The 300 argument indicates the length of the star's edge, and the 23
argument indicates the number of points for the star. (As a side note,
an even number of points are not perfectly handled, so an odd number
of points will yield the best results when calling this function.)</p>

<p>After executing this particular function, your slider should
automatically update to indicate the number of steps in the set of
instructions loaded by the star function.</p>

<h4>Scheme Interface for Turtle Graphics (Optional)</h4>

<p>This section is entirely optional. You may skip this, too!</p>

<p>The function <code>(find-turtle-graphics-widget)</code> in the code above locates
the TurtleGraphics widget in the interactor tree and returns its
unique ID. This ID is used to specify which TurtleGraphics component
the instructions apply to. So, for example, if we wanted to write a
set of Scheme commands to make the turtle rotate and move forward, we
could do the following:</p>

<pre><code>(define turtle-id (find-turtle-graphics-widget))
(turtle-rotate turtle-id 3.14)
(turtle-forward turtle-id 100 #t) ;; #t indicates to draw as it moves forward
</code></pre>

<p>This will cause the turtle to rotate 180 degrees, then move forward
100 pixels and draw as it moves forward.</p>

<p>There are Scheme analogues to each of the methods defined in
TurtleGraphics. Look for the list of turtle-graphics-functions in
<code>cs349_init.scm</code> for their corresponding Scheme names.</p>

<h2>Interaction Unit Tests</h2>

<p>As in the first assignment, you must write unit tests to test the
interaction. At a minimum, your unit tests should:</p>

<ul>
<li>Generate synthetic mouse events that are added to the event queue</li>
<li>Test each of the interactive widgets on the screen using synthetic
mouse events. You should have visible pauses (no longer than a few
seconds) between these actions, so you can see the events occur.</li>
</ul>

<p>Your unit tests should be added to A2UnitTests.cpp.</p>

<h2>Tips for Tackling this Assignment</h2>

<p>There is a lot of code to mull over, but you should be able to get
something up visible on the screen fairly quickly if you prioritize
your coding efforts.</p>

<p>Your initial efforts should be to copy over (and modify as necessary)
the parts of assignment 1 that you can reuse in this assignment.</p>

<p>The next major part to focus on is completing Component.cpp. This
class is a base class for all of the other interactive widgets on the
screen. Read the to-do items for that class and implement them. Make
sure you read the accompanying documentation and all of the comments
to understand what the missing code should do.</p>

<p>Once you have Component implemented, the TurtleGraphics component
should draw itself on screen. If it doesn't, you might want to try to
get something simpler on the screen to begin with. For example, you
can derive a Label class from Component and get it to paint itself on
the screen by doing nothing more than overriding and implementing the
PaintComponent() method. Once that works, then TurtleGraphics should
work, too.</p>

<p>After you have a Component and Label class working, move on to the
Button class. Then, from there, move on to the Slider class.</p>

<p>For Components that take text, rather than try to precisely define how
much space each letter takes, it is OK to come up with an average
amount of space per letter, and hard-code your components to that size.</p>

<p>The unit tests in A2UnitTests will also provide guidance on expected
behavior of elements of the toolkit. Your code should pass these unit
tests. (One of the tests for the Slider may seem broken at first --
it's not actually broken. When you encounter it, look at the
Rectangle class to understand how hit testing is done for Rectangles.
This will make more sense when/if that test fails for you...)</p>

<p>As a final hint, note that there is a lot of shared functionality
between components. For example, the TurtleGraphics class can be used
as a template and guide for how to add, remove, and notify listeners
via the ValueListener interface it supports.</p>

<h2>Constraints</h2>

<p>The majority of these constraints are the same as for assignment 1.
New or altered points are listed first.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><em>You may use color</em> for this assignment if you wish.</p></li>
<li><p>Your buttons can be purely graphical (as depicted in the sketch),
text-based, or a combination of either.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Slider class defines methods that allow it to be defined as a
vertical or horizontal slider. You only need to support horizontal
sliders for this assignment. Thus, you do not need to have code to
make it render vertically, and we will not test this feature of the API.</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>You may not change the existing APIs provided, but you may add to
them.</strong> If you feel something is horribly broken about the current
API's design, please talk to the instructor.</p></li>
<li><p>When marking your application, we will run the a2 and a2_unittests
binaries. As part of this testing, we will replace the
MarkingUnitTests.cpp file to compile in our own tests. What this means
is that the provided API should not change, otherwise, it will break
our unit tests. As stated above, all of your interactor tree should be
defined within MainPanel, rather than in the main function of the
application, so we can instantiate an instance of MainPanel, then
embed it in an XWindow of our choosing for testing.</p></li>
<li><p>You may choose alternative fonts, but will need to research this
possibility on your own. If you do change fonts, they will need to
exist in the virtual machine environment provided.</p></li>
<li><p>It is expected that you will use Internet search to help you find
relevant documentation. However, you should not search for specific
solutions to the assignment -- the work should be your own. <strong>Any code
you use from a third party should be clearly commented in your code.</strong>
This is a good practice to adopt, even outside of assignments, to help
you recall what resources you found valuable when developing a
solution.</p></li>
<li><p>Your application should be responsive without throttling the CPU. We
will test to ensure you don't max out the CPU when running.</p></li>
<li><p>You <em>may not</em> use threads -- you do not need to use them for this
assignment. Proper construction of the event loop will enable you to
have a responsive application without threads.</p></li>
<li><p>You do not need to double-buffer your application (don't worry if you
don't know what that means.)</p></li>
<li><p>TAs should be able to type <code>make</code> to produce the a2 and a2_unittests
binaries. The <code>Makefile</code> is already set up to do this for you.</p></li>
<li><p>Your code must compile on the class VM.</p></li>
<li><p>You should follow the instructions in the toolkit's README.md file
regarding logging of comments. <em>Do not use</em> stdout/stderr (e.g., printf,
fprintf, cout, cerr) for logging -- use the included logging toolkit.
<strong>We will deduct marks if you print debugging information to the
console when we have not set the logging level for debugging.</strong></p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Toolkit Bugs</h2>

<p>Given the size of the toolkit and the number of pieces of software
integrated with it (logging, unit tests, and the interpreter), there
<em>will</em> be bugs in the toolkit. However, we strive to make it as
bug-free as possible. Please report any bugs in the toolkit and we
will fix them as soon as possible.</p>

<h2>Marking</h2>

<p>Your assignment must conform to the specifications and constraints
listed above, and be aesthetically pleasing and <em>usable</em>.</p>

<p>We will not give strict or specific criteria for what constitutes an
aesthetically pleasing or usable design. It is up to <em>you</em> to test
these elements out with others. In achieving these goals, make sure
you don't sacrifice usability for aesthetics -- people should be able
to know how to use your interface without any assistance and with
minimal experimentation.</p>

<p>To repeat what was said above, in our unit tests, we will instantiate
instances of the MainPanel, and also create arbitrary Button and
Slider objects to test that they meet the specifications defined in
their API, <em>with one exception</em>: Your Slider implementation does not
need to honor being drawn vertically.</p>

<p>To reiterate, we will test both the a2 and a2_unittests binaries,
replacing the MarkingUnitTests.cpp file with our own unit tests. We
will also inspect your code to ensure it meets the requirements stated
above.</p>

<h2>Submitting the Assignment</h2>

<p>You'll submit using SVN. Instructions for submitting will be available
on the course web page.</p>
