<h1>CS 349 Assignment 1: Who Watches the StopWatchers?</h1>

<p><strong>The assignment is due Friday, January 17, 2014, at 5PM. No late
assignments will be accepted. Submit early and often!</strong></p>

<p>Source code for the assignment will be available to check out via
Subversion (SVN). See the
<a href="http://hci.uwaterloo.ca/courses/cs349/w14">class web page</a> for more
details about Subversion.</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>The goal of this assignment is to familiarize you with the basics of a
graphical user interface (GUI) toolkit. Specifically, you'll become
acquainted with the basics of events, event queues, responding to
events, and painting. You'll use the X11-based WatGUI toolkit provided
to create a stopwatch.</p>

<h2>What You'll Do</h2>

<p>In this assignment, you'll take the first steps towards completing the
WatGUI X11 toolkit, and create a basic stopwatch that can be started,
paused, and reset. The stopwatch will have both a numerical display
and a graphical display, as described below. You will also create unit
tests to test your application and interface.</p>

<h3>Completing the Toolkit</h3>

<p>In the toolkit, you must complete the missing portions of:</p>

<ul>
<li>XApplication.cpp</li>
<li>PaintEvent.cpp</li>
<li>StopWatch.cpp</li>
<li>EventQueue.cpp</li>
</ul>

<p>The provided toolkit is documented to assist you in understanding its
design and code. See the README.md file for information on the toolkit
(and for instructions on how to create its HTML-based documentation).</p>

<p>Note that there are other missing pieces of the toolkit, such as in
Component.cpp. You are free to complete these, if you wish, though
this assignment has been designed so that these other elements do
not need to be completed. However, completing these other portions
will give you a head start on assignment two, and also help you better
understand the internals of GUI toolkits.</p>

<h3>Visual Display and Design</h3>

<p>The StopWatch should have two displays: a numerical display that
displays the number of minutes, seconds, and milliseconds elapsed, and
a more abstract, real-time graphical rendering of the same
information. With very little effort (and without using text or
numbers), a user should be able to infer the percentage of time
elapsed from the graphical portion of the stopwatch alone.</p>

<p>The more abstract graphic display should have three elements that
depict the minutes, seconds, and milliseconds elapsed as a percentage
of time. The percentage of minutes should be calculated as a
percentage of tens of minutes (e.g., elapsed minutes % 10 / 10); for
seconds, it should be percentage of a minute (e.g., elapsed seconds %
60 / 60); and for milliseconds, it should be a percentage of a second
(e.g., current millisecond % 1000 / 1000). Note the modulo operator:
After 67 seconds, the display for seconds should represent 7/60.</p>

<h3>Interaction</h3>

<p>The stopwatch should respond to user input to support the following
functions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Starting the stopwatch</li>
<li>Pausing the stopwatch</li>
<li>Unpausing the stopwatch</li>
<li>Resetting it to zero</li>
</ul>

<p>Any user should be able to determine how to perform these operations
without any assistance or instructions. <em>To ensure the usability of
your stopwatch, you should test your app out with a friend who you can
trust to provide critical feedback of your design. Do not ask the TAs
or instructors if the design is "good enough" -- we'll just ask you
what results you obtained from testing it with others.</em></p>

<h3>Interaction Unit Tests</h3>

<p>While the means of meeting the above design specifications are up to
you, you must write unit tests to test the interaction. At a minimum,
your unit tests should:</p>

<ul>
<li>Generate synthetic mouse events that are added to the event queue</li>
<li>Test the start, pause, unpause, and reset functionality via these
synthetic mouse events. You should have visible pauses (no longer than
a few seconds) between these actions, so you can see the events occur.
(There is plenty of code within the toolkit that shows how to pause
execution for a fixed amount of time.)</li>
</ul>

<p>To make meaningful unit tests in this fashion, you will need to add
state variables to the StopWatch class to determine whether it is
running, paused, or reset.</p>

<p>Your unit tests should be added to A1UnitTests.cpp. This file contains
an example to follow.</p>

<h2>Constraints</h2>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>You may not change the existing APIs provided, but you may add to
them.</strong> If you feel something is horribly broken about the current
API's design, please talk to the instructor.</p></li>
<li><p>When marking your application, we will run the a1 and a1_unittests
binaries. As part of this testing, we will replace the
MarkingUnitTests.cpp file to compile in our own tests. What this means
is that the provided API should not change, otherwise, it will break
our unit tests. This also means that you should not have important
code for your StopWatch class in your application's main function,
because it won't get executed when running our marking unit tests.</p></li>
<li><p>You may only use a monochromatic color scheme (e.g., black and white),
and you may not use bitmapped images. These constraints are intended
to encourage you to focus on visual composition.</p></li>
<li><p>You may choose alternative fonts, but will need to research this
possibility on your own. If you do change fonts, they will need to
exist in the virtual machine environment provided.</p></li>
<li><p>It is expected that you will use Internet search to help you find
relevant documentation. However, you should not search for specific
solutions to the assignment -- the work should be your own. <strong>Any code
you use from a third party should be clearly commented in your code.</strong>
This is a good practice to adopt, even outside of assignments, to help
you recall what resources you found valuable when developing a
solution.</p></li>
<li><p>Your StopWatch application should be responsive without throttling the
CPU. We will test to ensure you don't max out the CPU when running.</p></li>
<li><p>You <em>may not</em> use threads -- you do not need to use them for this
assignment. Proper construction of the event loop will enable you to
have a responsive application without threads.</p></li>
<li><p>You do not need to double-buffer your application (don't worry if you
don't know what that means.)</p></li>
<li><p>TAs should be able to type <code>make</code> to produce the a1 and a1_unittests
binaries. The <code>Makefile</code> is already set up to do this for you.</p></li>
<li><p>Your code must compile on the class VM.</p></li>
<li><p>You should follow the instructions in the toolkit's README.md file
regarding logging of comments. <em>Do not use</em> stdout/stderr (e.g., printf,
fprintf, cout, cerr) for logging -- use the included logging toolkit.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Toolkit Bugs</h2>

<p>Given the size of the toolkit and the number of pieces of software
integrated with it (logging, unit tests, and the interpreter), there
<em>will</em> be bugs in the toolkit. However, we strive to make it as
bug-free as possible. Please report any bugs in the toolkit and we
will fix them as soon as possible.</p>

<h2>Marking</h2>

<p>Your assignment must conform to the specifications and constraints
listed above, and be aesthetically pleasing and <em>usable</em>.</p>

<p>Note that the abstract graphical output and interaction specs are
intentionally underdefined to give you an opportunity to creatively
address the requirements provided. We will not give strict or specific
criteria for what constitutes an aesthetically pleasing or usable
design. It is up to <em>you</em> to test these elements out with others. In
achieving these goals, make sure you don't sacrifice usability for
aesthetics -- people should be able to learn how to use your stopwatch
without any assistance and with minimal experimentation.</p>

<p>To reiterate, we will test both the a1 and a1_unittests binaries,
replacing the MarkingUnitTests.cpp file with our own unit tests. We
will also inspect your code to ensure it meets the requirements stated
above.</p>

<h2>Submitting the Assignment</h2>

<p>You'll submit using SVN. Instructions for submitting will be available
on the course web page.</p>
