      <h1 id="cs349assignment3fruitslasher">CS 349 Assignment 3: Fruit Slasher</h1>

<p><strong>This assignment is due Monday March 10 2014 @ 5 PM (This has been revised from the original due date). No late assignments will be accepted! Make sure that you add and commit everything properly, and speak with course staff if you need any help with SVN.</strong> </p>

<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p>The goal of this assignment is to build an interactive game, demonstrating your mastery of: </p>

<ul>
<li>Model-View-Controller design patterns</li>
<li>Java Swing, 2D graphics and transformations</li>
<li>Direct manipulation and using a mouse to interact with shapes</li>
</ul>

<p>You will build a real-time game, similar to <a href="http://fruitninja.com">Fruit Ninja</a>. In this game, shapes move onto the screen from random positions at the bottom of the screen. The player must use the mouse to &#8220;slice&#8221; fruit into two slices; points are awarded for every piece of fruit that is successfully split. </p>

<p>This is a screencap from the actual Fruit Ninja game.<br/>

<p>Your game might look more like this.<br/>

<h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2>

<p>The following guidelines describe <em>gameplay</em>: </p>

<ul>
<li>Your game should consist of a window, displaying the title, high-score, elapsed time and play area. Your game should be entirely playable using a mouse.</li>
<li>When the game is running, random fruit shapes will fly up from the bottom of the screen, reach the top of their ascent somewhere in the middle of the screen, and then drop and fall off the bottom of the screen.</li>
<li>The player interacts with fruit by <em>slicing</em> it: pressing the mouse button, dragging across a piece of fruit, and then releasing the mouse button. The slice created in the fruit should match up with the line created by the start/end points of the mouse drag. The alignment doesn&#8217;t need to be perfect, but it should be a reasonable match (so that you can, for instance, bisect a piece of fruit into smaller 1/5 and 4/5 size pieces).</li>
<li>After a piece of fruit is split, it must break apart as described above, and the remaining two pieces should then fall off the screen.</li>
<li>You don&#8217;t need to allow sub-slices (i.e. you <em>don&#8217;t</em> need to support splitting fruit into more than two pieces).</li>
<li>Points are awarded for each piece of fruit that is successfully sliced. A high-score should display a running total. You can choose a meaningful scale.</li>
<li>A timer should indicate how much time (min:sec) has elapsed for the current game.</li>
<li>If more than 5 pieces of fruit are missed (i.e. allowed to fall off the bottom of the screen without being sliced), then the game ends. When this happens, you should allow the user to start a new game (which clears the high score and resets the timer!)</li>
<li>Your game should be compelling: animations should happen at a fast-enough pace that an average player or TA can successfully play the game.</li>
<li>You must support more than a single piece of fruit on-screen at the same time: you can have a random number of shapes animating, or have a progression (i.e. it starts out easy and adds more pieces as you continue playing). You need to decide what is compelling.</li>
</ul>

<p>The following are <em>implementation requirements</em>: </p>

<ul>
<li>Your game just be built entirely in Java 7 (1.7.025 is installed in the VM and that&#8217;s fine). No third-party toolkits or libraries are allowed (<em>see below</em>) but you may use any of the sample code provided in this course.</li>
<li>Starter code is provided (link below), which you can use as the basis of your assignment. The starter code is an almost-complete implementation of drawing and slicing fruit: filling in the missing pieces of the Fruit class will make it functional. Note that doing this will not get you a complete application; you will still need to add animation, timers and so on.</li>
<li>You can make any changes that you want to the starter code (or even write everything yourself), except that you <em>must</em> have a <em>Fruit</em> class that implements <em>FruitInterface</em>.</li>
<li>The UI should be drawn using Java Swing components. The sample code is fairly functional, and uses a <code>java.awt.Area</code> to represent Fruit. This is particularly helpful, as it provides intersection methods that you can use when slicing your fruit. If you want more complex shapes (e.g. using bitmaps for textures), you will probably need to write a custom class to do this - just make sure to implement the <code>FruitInterface</code>.</li>
<li>Your code must utilize the MVC pattern, and your interface should consist of one or more views. The model should contain the list of shapes to be drawn. The MVC implementation in the sample code is a reasonable starting point.</li>
<li>This is a real-time game, and should exhibit smooth animations and gameplay. Marks will be partially based on performance and interactivity.</li>
<li>As per the submission guidelines below, you must include a <code>makefile</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="resources/a3starter.zip">Download starter code here</a>. To install the starter code in SVN: </p>

<ol>
<li><code>svn update</code> your SVN working directory.</li>
<li><code>mkdir a3</code> to create your assignment directory.</li>
<li>Download the starter code and copy the zip file into this directory. 
<li><code>unzip a3starter.zip</code> to unzip the file.</li>
<li><code>svn add a3/</code> to add the directory and all of its contents, then <code>svn commit</code> everything.</li>
<li><code>svn status</code> should not show any changes pending.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="testing">Testing</h2>

<p>You do not need to write unit tests for this assignment. Note however, that TAs will aggressively deduct marks if your assignment crashes, segfaults, or otherwise behaves erratically. Test test test! </p>

<h2 id="submission">Submission</h2>

<p>All code must be checked into SVN by the deadline specified above. You must provide a <strong>makefile</strong> that will build and run your application. You <em>may</em> check in your IDE project files but we will not open and build your project in an IDE. Your project <strong>must compile and run from the command line</strong> to receive full marks. This means that </p>

<ul>
<li><code>make</code> will build your project</li>
<li><code>make run</code> will build and run it</li>
<li><code>make clean</code> will remove all *.class files</li>
</ul>

<p>Also, when submitting in SVN, remember to </p>

<ul>
<li><code>svn add</code> all of your files that you want to include</li>
<li><code>svn commit</code> all of your changes</li>
</ul>

<p>To check that you&#8217;ve submitted properly, <code>svn checkout</code> to a different directory and make sure that builds and works properly. If your second checkout works differently, it&#8217;s because you&#8217;ve made a mistake submitting it. </p>

<h2 id="gettingstarted">Getting Started</h2>

<p>Here&#8217;s some suggestions on how to get started. </p>

<ul>
<li>Unzip the starter code into SVN, as described above.</li>
<li>Sketch out how you want your application to work, and how you need to support that functionality (i.e. how your model should behave, what views you might need).</li>
<li>Read the sample code, and modify the Main, View and Model to suit your functionality.</li>
<li>Iterate to progressively add features. Build the <em>simplest thing that works</em>, then iterate on that.</li>
<li>Follow the hints provided in the starter code to get it working.</li>
<li>Check into SVN often! We only look at the final submission, so there&#8217;s no harm in checking in code as you&#8217;re building it.</li>
<li>Use an IDE! There are some excellent Java tools that will greatly improve your productivity, and make it easier to debug problems that will crop up. <a href="http://www.eclipse.org">Eclipse</a> and <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/index.html">IntelliJ</a> are both excellent Java IDEs and highly recommended. (Note: the VM doesn&#8217;t have an IDE installed by default, but it&#8217;s simple to download and install from the sites listed above).</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="non-requirements">Non-Requirements</h2>

<p>The following are things that you should not do for this assignment. </p>

<ul>
<li>Do not include any third-party libraries. Your code should rely exclusively on native Java packages. An exception is the use of third-party resources (art, music), which <em>may</em> be used if their license allows it (e.g. Creative Commons license).</li>
<li>The Google logging framework <em>glog</em> that you used in A1 and A2 isn&#8217;t required (or available in Java). The <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/logging/package-summary.html">java.util.logging package</a> is recommended for logging and debugging.</li>
